    var body: some View {

        }
        .sheet(isPresented: $showParentGate) {
            ParentGate(
                isPresented: $showParentGate,
                challenge: ParentGateChallenge.randomChallenge().question,
                correctAnswer: ParentGateChallenge.randomChallenge().answer,
                onSuccess: {
                    // Handle successful parent verification
                    print("Parent verified successfully!")
                }
            )
        }
    }
}
```

### Available Challenges

The package comes with several pre-defined challenges:

- Math challenges (e.g., "What is 7 + 3?")
- Word challenges (e.g., "What is the opposite of 'hot'?")
- Simple math challenges (e.g., "What is 5 Ã— 4?")

    question: "What is your favorite color?",
    answer: "blue"
)
```
